            <h1> ìàñ ê§å M</h1>
            <p>‚Äúm‚Äù is derived from the heiroglyph corresponding to water ripples this is why nearly every African
                language has the ‚Äúm‚Äù sound in the corresponding words for water. Water is the source of life this is
                why, the prefix mu/mo is used for living people and things and has also influenced words corresponding
                to mother and women.</p>
            <h1>ìâê ê§Å B</h1>
            <p>The prefix ba/aba comes from the hieroglyph representing an enclosure because the family/ community lived
                in such structures, it is symbolic of a grouping. This has influenced the words associated with men and
                fathers since they are typically the protector/leaders of such structures.</p>
            <h1>ìÜì ê§ç N</h1>
            <p>These all correspond to the heiroglyph of a snake / <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seraph">"seraphim"</a> which is where the letters corresponding
                to ‚ÄúN‚Äù of various writing systems come from, The snake used to be on Kushite/Egyptian crowns which
                demonstrates a clear cultural continuity with the Zulu and Ndebele umqhele. The Egyptian crowns were not
                actually crowns but rather hair <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teifWMAe2Qg">accessories</a>
                that often can only fit on African hair. </p>
            <h1>ìÑ§ ìäñ T</h1>
            <p>The letter for T is derived from Thaba / Intaba / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teth"> "Tab"
                </a>. Elevated places have always had positive conotations in African / Israelite culture because it
                represents being closer to god. In Ancient Egypt it meant <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teth">good</a>, as the nile flows downhill from the promised
                land,
                and is why the Israelites went up when they left Egypt. This is why Jesus became radiant on Thaba / <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Tabor">"Mount Tabor"</a>. Additionally, the letter X
                originally called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taw">Taw</a> in the early writing systems,
                which is
                from Tau / Intare that means lion. Hence why there was <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seqenenre_Tao">"Seqenenre Tao</a> who was also known as "The
                brave"
                in Egypt when he ruled over Thebe and fought against the babylonian colonisers. The meaning of crosses
                has
                always been significant, this why they modified the letters corresponding to the crosses early on. Judah
                =
                Chi Tau = ìäñìäΩ = ê§éê§ï , but the Greeks created the "T" for Tau and then called ê§ï <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_(letter)">Chi</a> and removed the true Chi ê§é , but they
                will
                say that "Ch" is pronounced "K". This lie has resulted in discrepencies, Arkitects build Arches,
                churches
                are headed by Archbishops but the greeks were ruled by <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon">Arkons</a>. Since modern day greeks do not know their
                story
                they currently speak a language distinct from "Ancient" Greek and believe what ever anyone says about
                the
                language of their ancestors. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao">Tao</a> is also signicant in
                Chinese philosophy.
            </p>
            <h1>ìäΩ ê§é Ch </h1>
            <p> The letter they removed because it was a symbol that represented truth of the Holy Trinity and it's
                Egyptian origins. The Egyptians called the letter the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djed">Djed</a> which represented a spiritual backbone connecting
                men to the creator. This is why in Europe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_Church">
                    Bosnian Church</a> used to refer to their church bishops as "Djed". Unsurprisingly they were
                persecuted by the Catholic Church that changed their story. The concept of "Jedi" and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(deity)">"Sith"</a> in the Star Wars movies was nothing more
                than approriation of the true story of light and darkness. The other name for King Solomon was Jedidiah.
                Despite colonial manipulation, the influence
                of Chi is worldwide. Both the Igbo people of Nigeria and the Chinese, refer to Chi as the spiritual life
                force of a person. The language of a community in Africa came to represent collective Chi, hence why in
                Tumbuka "Chi" means "in the manner of" and they speak ChiTumbuka because Chi became the prefix for
                language which evolved into Se/isi in other languages. More proof of the influence of Judah can be found
                in the Heiroglyph TOC. </p>
            <h1>ìÅ∂ ê§ì R</h1>
            <p>Ra in Egypt refered to the spirtual light and the sun, R / L are <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_consonant">liquid consonants</a> which means they often
                switch. This is is why Light is Right and the Karanga are the same as the Bakalanga which means "people
                from the sun (langa / ranga ). It is often used for word related to leader, in Yoruba Ori still means
                head like the symbol depicts e.g "Ori Obba" = "the Head King".</p>

                The Hebrews or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BFApiru">"·∏™abiru" / "·∏´abatu"</a> in the middle
                east were described as nomads, raiders and people who were not part of their cultural society. . The
                Egyptian/Kemetic
                word for the same people was "Montu" that they symbolised with the falcon of Horus/Heroes (The falcon is
                the only animal able to stare directly at the sun i.e the right light). Montu was
                celebrated in Egypt for attacking the enemies of truth and divine order. Due to the ignorance of Western
                Academia, the meaning of "montu" has been reduced to "nomad" and its true symbolism has been discarded
                as "mythology". The truth is that Bantu/Abantu are descended from Montu, "Montu" is just the singular of
                "Bantu". The colonisation of Egypt and destruction of their story has tainted his-story and the world
                has forgotten who the true story tellers are, but the truth still lives in the scriptures and our
                language even though the Hero-glyphs have become a Missed-story.<img src="220px-Montu.svg.png" alt=""

                Hebrew is derived from heiroglyphs, the jews left Egypt with moses hence why the "Bantu" languages are
                related to both.<br><br>
