            <h1>Hebrew is Bantu</h1>
            <p> The original hebrew script did not have vowels so the vowels differ the most because theyre the easiest
                to
                change when you have the wrong people claiming the language.</p>

        <div class="panel">
            <h1> 𓈖 𐤌 M</h1>
            <p>“m” is derived from the heiroglyph corresponding to water ripples this is why nearly every African
                language has the “m” sound in the corresponding words for water. Water is the source of life this is
                why, the prefix mu/mo is used for living people and things and has also influenced words corresponding
                to mother and women.</p>
            <h1>𓉐 𐤁 B</h1>
            <p>The prefix ba/aba comes from the hieroglyph representing an enclosure because the family/ community lived
                in such structures, it is symbolic of a grouping. This has influenced the words associated with men and
                fathers since they are typically the protector/leaders of such structures.</p>
            <h1>𓆓 𐤍 N</h1>
            <p>These all correspond to the heiroglyph of a snake / <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seraph">"seraphim"</a> which is where the letters corresponding
                to “N” of various writing systems come from, The snake used to be on Kushite/Egyptian crowns which
                demonstrates a clear cultural continuity with the Zulu and Ndebele umqhele. The Egyptian crowns were not
                actually crowns but rather hair <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teifWMAe2Qg">accessories</a>
                that often can only fit on African hair. </p>
            <h1>𓄤 𓊖 T</h1>
            <p>The letter for T is derived from Thaba / Intaba / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teth"> "Tab"
                </a></p>. Elevated places have always had positive conotations in African / Israelite culture because it
            represent being closer to god. In Ancient Egypt it meant <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teth">good</a>, as the nile flows downhill from the promised land,
            and is why the Israelites went up when they left Egypt. This is why Jesus became radiant on Thaba / <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Tabor">"Mount Tabor"</a>. Additionally, the letter X
            originally called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taw">Taw</a> in the early writing system, which is
            from Tau / Intare that means lion. Hence why there was <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seqenenre_Tao">"Seqenenre Tao</a> who was also known as "The brave"
            in Egypt when he ruled over Thebe and fought against the babylonian colonisers. The meaning of crosses has
            always been significant, this why they modified the letters corresponding to the crosses early on. Judah =
            Chi Tau = 𓊖𓊽 = 𐤎𐤕 , but the Greeks created the "T" for Tau and then called 𐤕 <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_(letter)">Chi</a> and removed the true Chi 𐤎 , but they will
            say that "Ch" is pronounced "K". This lie has resulted in discrepencies, Arkitects build Arches, churches
            are headed by Archbishops but the greeks were ruled by <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon">Arkons</a>. Since modern day greeks do not know their story
            they currently speak a language distinct from "Ancient" Greek and believe what ever anyone says about the
            language of their ancestors. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao">Tao</a> is also signicant in
            Chinese philosophy.
            <h1>𓊽 𐤎 Ch </h1>
            <p> The letter they removed because it was a symbol that represented truth of the Holy Trinity and it's
                Egyptian origins. The Egyptians called the letter the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djed">Djed</a> which represented a spiritual backbone connecting
                men to the creator. This is why in Europe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_Church">
                    Bosnian Church</a> used to refer to their church bishops as "Djed". Unsurprisingly they were
                persecuted by the Catholic Church that changed their story. The concept of "Jedi" and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(deity)">"Sith"</a> in the Star Wars movies was nothing more
                than approriation of the true story of light and darkness. Despite colonial manipulation, the influence
                of Chi is worldwide. Both the Igbo people of Nigeria and the Chinese, refer to Chi as the spiritual life
                force of a person. The language of a community in Africa came to represent collective Chi, hence why in
                Tumbuka "Chi" means "in the manner of" and they speak ChiTumbuka because Chi became the prefix for
                language which evolved into Se/isi in other languages. </p>

        <div class="panel">

                The Hebrews or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BFApiru">"Ḫabiru" / "ḫabatu"</a> in the middle
                east were described as nomads, raiders and people who were not part of their cultural society. <img
                    src="220px-Montu.svg.png" alt="" class="float-right" style="max-width:25vw">. The Egyptian/Kemetic
                word for the same people was "Montu" that they symbolised with the falcon of Horus/Heroes. Montu was
                celebrated in Egypt for attacking the enemies of truth and divine order. Due to the ignorance of Western
                Academia, the meaning of "montu" has been reduced to "nomad" and its true symbolism has been discarded
                as "mythology". The truth is that Bantu/Abantu are descended from Montu, "Montu" is just the singular of
                "Bantu". The colonisation of Egypt and destruction of their story has tainted his-story and the world
                has forgotten who the true story tellers are, but the truth still lives in the scriptures and our
                language even though the Hero-glyphs have become a Missed-story.

            </p>



            <h1>Hebrew, Heiroglyphs are African languages</h1>
            <p>Hebrew is derived from heiroglyphs, jews left Egypt, bantu language shows relations to
                both</p>
            <p>
                <img src="habiru.png" alt="" class="float-left" style="max-width:25vw">

                These all correspond to the heiroglyph of a
                snake which is where the letters
                corresponding to “N” of various writing
                systems come from, The snake used to be
                on Kushite/Egyptian crowns this is what the
                Zulu and Ndebele umqhele is based on.
                The Egyptian crowns were not actually crowns but rather
                hair accessories that often can only fit on African hair you
                can watch here to see how the many “crowns” have
                influenced the cultures of today.
                It is already an academic fact that the semitic scripts are
                descended from hieroglyphs, and all the writings systems
                are derived from semitic scripts. Hieroglyphs represent a
                writing system where each character has its own meaning
                and sound and thus by combining the different hieroglyphs
                you can create words that have new meaning based on the
                combined sounds and symbols.
                This is why in Isaiah 36:11 The language of the Hebrews is
                described as the language of the “people of the wall”, this is
                a reference to the fact that hieroglyphs were written on
                walls and the people who spoke the language were often
                depicted on the same walls, this makes sense considering
                the Hebrews came from Egypt.
                The “Bantu” language all have class systems dividing the
                vocabulary because the different classes correspond to
                different prefixes and the prefixes are descended from the
                original hieroglyphs, this is why the languages have what
                linguists call an “agglutinative” structure, where the addition
                of individual sounds can add meaning to a sentence.
                The letter “m” is derived from the heiroglyph corresponding
                to water ripples this is why nearly every African language
                has the “m” sound in the corresponding words for
                water, water is the source of life this is why, the
                prefix “mu”/“mo” is used for living people and
                things and has also influenced words corresponding to
                mother and women because they are the source of life.
                The prefix “ba”/“aba” comes from the hieroglyph
                representing an enclosure because the family/
                community lived in such structures, it is symbolic of
                a grouping. This has influenced the words
                associated with men and fathers since they are typically the
                protector/leaders of such structures.
