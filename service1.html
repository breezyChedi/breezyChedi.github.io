                The Egyptian spirtual system and story was about a kingdom of light and darkness, chaos and order and
                their symbolism reflected this. The eurocentric perspective and rewriting of his-story has mystified the
                Egyptian beliefs and distorted the afrocentric truth that can be found in the scriptures of the
                Abrahamic religions. The kingdom of Kush

                <br>Religion is a construct, true Christianity is from Egypt
                it is important to understand that the beliefs of the
                Egyptians have been distorted purposefully with the use of the Eurocentrec bias perspective so when they
                can not understand their
                symbolism they will simplify it by describing it as a “deity”
                and they will say there were all these different “Cults” in
                Egypt, a similar tactic used during the expansion of
                Islam and Christianity into Africa.
                <img src="maat.jpg" alt="" class="float-right" style="max-width:25vw">
                The different so called “deities” are often the different ways
                of describing the creator and their attributes that are in us
                and around us. The early christians who were later labelled
                as “Heretics” use a similar concept of <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeon_(Gnosticism)">Aeons</a> during the Greek era.
                They want people to view Egypt as a
                source of paganism rather than Greco-Rome, so that they
                can distort and manipulate the truth that came out of Africa.
                <br><br>
                The foreign conquerors and subsequent egyptologists will take the symbols and say that they were all
                different gods that the Egyptians worshipped, which they label polytheist yet ironically they dont label
                the Holy Trinity of Christianity as polytheist. The Eurocentric lens fails to interpret the
                symbolism of Egypt thus hiding the cultural appropriation that took place.

                The temple of Amen still stands in Sudan, Amun / Amen / Amani
                is present in the names of many Kushite / Nubian / Egyptian leaders such as the last Queen of Kush
                Amanirena <a href="https://breezychedi.github.io/about.html"></a>(Amen reigns). These temples were
                highly valued in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kingdom_of_Egypt">“New Kingdom Egypt"
                </a>
                also known as the Egyptian Empire, the unity of Judah, Kush and Egypt was described in Isaiah 19:17-19.

                demonstrates an early Jewish
                presence in Upper Egypt that were worshipping in Egyptian temples and had no knowledge of the written
                Torah. It also well known that many Jews became the early Christians
                in Egypt and Kush / Ethiopia.
                <br>
                Modern historiography will tell you that before the religion of Christianity
                was created by the romans the Osiris “myth” was
                the most common belief throughout the Roman empire. The Roman leaders persecuted Christians and Jew sfor
                centuries before creating their religion of Christianity through the Catholic Church where they
                manipulated the truth to justify evil and persecuted other sects that were closer to the truth of it.
                <img src="maat.jpg" alt="" class="float-left" style="max-width:25vw">
                The Nag Hammadi Library found in upper Egypt
                demonstrates the early christian presence and contains
                many scriptures that were excluded.

                The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris_myth">"Osiris myth”</a> is essentially a story of how
                god came
                to earth in earth and was destined to die due to the influence of Seth (Satan) but in doing so restored
                balance to the corrupted world. The symbolism the
                Egyptians used for Seth was consistent with their
                symbolism for foreigners which makes sense because it was Roman Empire that killed Jesus.<img
                    src="Khonsu.svg.png" alt="" class="float-right" style="max-width:25vw">
                After the death of Osiris he is reborn as Chonsu, Chonsu is
                depicted essentially the same as Osiris except Chonsu has
                the Djed pillar in his hand which represents the new
                kingdom and has the sun on his head because he is the
                source of light, son / sun of god. Additionally a crook and flail are used which are
                symbols of a shepherd.
                This Djed is what becomes the early symbol of the triple cross <a
                    href="https://breezychedi.github.io/service5.html">𐤎 </a> corresponding to the

                The temple of Chonsu is located in the Karnak Temple Complex which
                is intelligently designed so that the main corridor and
                “shrine” is illuminated perfectly by the rising sun during the
                mid-winter solstice in the northern hemisphere, the date of
                the mid winter solstice used to be December 25th on the
                Roman calendar i.e Christmas.

                The Roman Nicene creed was one of many instances of the Truth being manipulated and religion being
                standardised. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nag_Hammadi_library">Nag Hammadi Library</a> in
                Egypt and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Tewahedo_biblical_canon">The Ethiopian

                was created by the romans the Osiris “myth” was
                the most common belief throughout the Roman empire. The Roman leaders persecuted Christians and Jew sfor
                centuries before creating their religion of Christianity through the Catholic Church where they
                manipulated the truth to justify evil and persecuted other sects that were closer to the truth of it.

                The Nag Hammadi Library found in upper Egypt
                demonstrates the early christian presence and contains
                many scriptures that were excluded.

                The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris_myth">"Osiris myth”</a> is essentially a story of how
                god came
                to earth in earth and was destined to die due to the influence of Seth (Satan) but in doing so restored
                balance to the corrupted world. The symbolism the
                Egyptians used for Seth was consistent with their
                symbolism for foreigners which makes sense because it was Roman Empire that killed Jesus.<img

                After the death of Osiris he is reborn as Chonsu, Chonsu is
                depicted essentially the same as Osiris except Chonsu has
                the Djed pillar in his hand which represents the new
                kingdom and has the sun on his head because he is the
                source of light, son / sun of god. Additionally a crook and flail are used which are
                symbols of a shepherd.
                This Djed is what becomes the early symbol of the triple cross <a
                    href="https://breezychedi.github.io/service5.html">𐤎 </a> corresponding to the
                the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity">Holy Trinity</a> / <a

                caused one of the earliest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schism_in_Christianity">schisms</a>
                this is why they removed 𐤎 Chi from the alphabet.

                The temple of Chonsu is located in the Karnak Temple Complex which
                is intelligently designed so that the main corridor and
                “shrine” is illuminated perfectly by the rising sun during the
                mid-winter solstice in the northern hemisphere, the date of
                the mid winter solstice used to be December 25th on the
                Roman calendar i.e Christmas.
                The Hebrew / Rasta / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asase_Ya/Afua">Akan</a> Yah / Jah is
                equivalent to "Iah" of Egypt, he
                represents the adult form of Chonsu the son of god.

                The Roman Nicene creed was one of many instances of the Truth being manipulated and religion being
                standardised. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nag_Hammadi_library">Nag Hammadi Library</a> in
                Egypt and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Tewahedo_biblical_canon">The Ethiopian
                    bible</a> have many
                scriptures excluded.

                <br>The Islamic narrative says that there were Jews that believed <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzair"></a>Osiris was the son of god and the western narrative
                identifies the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_the_1st_century">earliest
                    Christians</a> as being jews<br>
