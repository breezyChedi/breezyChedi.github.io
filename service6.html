        <p style="margin-top: 80px;padding-top: 60px;">Art of Storytelling and etymologies, who was telling the true
            story, whose stories dont get told. Western His story begins with the colonisation of "Ancient" Egypt
            by "Ancient" Greece and subsequent appropriation of their belief systems and concepts. It was proven using
            statistical methods by the Soviet Mathematician Anatoly Fomenko Jr that they were forging history by
            duplicating chronologies and applying it to different identities to the extent that it can not be verified
            that the year is 2024. This was done in an era where power was centralised among the Vatican, Aristocracy,
            Merchants and bankers, violence became justified if you told a story and violence is profitable. The truths
            of Europe have become missed-stories which has caused their primitive culture to be the source of the most
            deadly conflicts in history. European historians claim there were "Dark Ages" lasting centuries,
            constructing a distinction between Greece and "Ancient" Greece like they then did to Egypt after they
            colonised it and renamed places, a strategy used through out his story to change the true story. The
            creation of the Western lens has distorted our ideas of whats true and the effects are clear when looking at
            the neo-colonial system orchestrated by the multinational merchants, private banks and international
            organisations that do not serve us. This lens is why Israel is not considered a terroist state. It is why
            the world is expected to care about Ukraines conflict but remain silent on the violence in Congo and Sudan
            that Israel and many nations profit from. It is obvious who controls the narrative and theyve been
            controlling it for a long time. Yet their oldest stories took place in Africa, before our story became oral
            his story and the hero glyphs became heiroglyphs. </p>

                Moshe was. When moses went up there was so much smoke that the rest of the Israelites were scared and
                remained off the mountain. This is why Moshi / Musi means smoke in Swahilli / Sepedi. Numerous groups in

                The Kushites / Egyptians were the orignal Christians, this is why theres a <a

                    Hypostle hall</a> was designed such that it was perfectly illuminated during the Winter Solstice
                which used to be on the 25th of December (Christmas) before the Roman Empire <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice">modified</a> the calendar. The orignal trinity
                was represent by Amen (man) - the creator, Mut (mother) - the holy spirit, Chonsu - the chosen son.
                Patriarchy begins when Mut became Myth and her story became a miss-story. This is why <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iah">Jah / Ya</a> was also used as a name for Chonsu, identical
                to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jah">Hebrew</a>. The Egyptian<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris_myth">"Osiris Myth"</a> was about god walking on earth,
                getting murdered and then being reborn as Chonsu the child of Amen and Mut, the Father in heaven and the
                holy spirit thus maintaing divine order and balance. It should not surprise Christians that the Ancient
                Egyptians worshiped the true god and were unified with the Jews since its detailed in scripture Isaiah
                19:17-25, furthermore 2 Kings 19:9 and Isaiah 37:9 explains explicitly that <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taharqa">Tirhaqa </a>, King of Kush was fighting on behalf of
                the God of Israel. Notice that this geographically does not make sense with the fake Israel because
                Palestine is adjacent to Assyria far from Egypt and Kush, so Egypt and Kush would obviously not be able
                to act as a buffer state for Israel like they're described in scripture.<br> <i>From beyond the rivers
                    of Cush my worshipers, my scattered people, will bring me offerings.</i><br><b>-Zephaniah 3:10</b>
