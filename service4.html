                Paternal and maternal haplogroups are genetic markers
                that reveal your paternal and maternal lineages <img src="e1b1a.png" alt="Description of Image 1"
                    class="float-left" style="max-width:25vw">
                respectively. The different haplogroups correspond to
                different gene pools of different ancestors, when group of
                people diverge into different directions and environments,
                that is when the haplogroups form “subclades” and mutate
                differently (single-nucleotide polymorphism mutation).
                The “Bantu” people are primarily of haplogroup E,
                specifically E1B1A, this represents a divergence from
                E1B1B which is found in north Africa, the Mediterranean
                and in high proportions among jewish communities in
                Europe. The KhoeKhoe, San, Twa
                related groups carry the paternal haplogroups A and B
                which are exclusive to Africa, the historical range of these
                haplogroups used to stretch from the Western Cape as far
                north as Sudan/Ethiopia, the gene is present in their descendants. Paternal haplogroups A, B are distinct from E which correlates with the linguistic differences between them.
                Some western academics make the fictional claim that
                there was a “Bantu expansion” owhere those with E1B1A appeared somewhere in central
                Africa out of nowhere and then their population suddenly exploded
                significantly. Oral history, Archaeology, Genetics and the Old Testament all show that narrative to be false.
                A false division has been created between North Africa (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Egypt">Lower Africa</a>) and "sub-saharan" Africa (<a href="https://www.ladycarnarvon.com/kemet/">Kemet</a>)
                The story of the land that the Nile flows from has been told by foreign colonisers. The victors write his story, we must know our story.

                Scripture will tell you that the Hebrews left Egypt and
                entered the land of Canaan.
                Canaan was a son of Ham and the
                'Hamites' (Cham / Kemet) referred to African people. The Book of Jubilees (excluded
                from roman descended bibles) describes very explicitly The
                allocation of land to the different descendants of Noah
                (Shem, Ham, Japheth)<img src="TOmap.jpg" alt="" class="float-right" style="max-width:25vw"> was described in the Book of Jubilees that was excluded by the Romans from their Bible. and allocates Africa to the sons of
                Ham. When Noah allocated land to his 3 sons he was doing
                so not only to his sons but also their descendants since you
                inherit land from your parents.
                The Hebrews after leaving Egypt enter the land of Canaan,
                the Canaanites are the Khoi and their related groups, this is
                where the derogatory term “Hottentot” comes from because
                the Hebrew/semitic scripts do not have vowels and
                Hottentot is simply Hitite with dutch phonetics, the Hitites
                are described as part of the Canaanites in scripture. The
                dutch and the huguenots knew whose land they were in,
                this is why they named many places in the country after
                locations in the bible.

                This is also why during the “great” trek some of the boers
                known as the “Jerusalemgangers” split off towards Namibia
                because they believed that Jerusalem was not that far from
                them and that they were the chosen Israelites.

                If you ask the fake jews what are the genetic markers for
                the Canaanites or the Hebrews they will not be able to tell
                you in a way that makes sense, that is because they are
                lying.

            <p> The "red" sea that Moses crossed was in fact a "Sea of Reeds" based on the original Hebrew.
                There used to be a large
                <img src="oldrivers.png" alt="" class="float-left" style="max-width:25vw">
                lake in the region of Sudan,
                north of whats currently
                called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur">“Darfur”</a> (Previously called DarDaju = "Home of Da-Jew" in Arabic).
                Some academics will try to
                convince  you that this was
                6000 years ago, 
                when the entire Sahara was
                green but proper
                investigation will show it
                was relatively recent, the Greeks were aware of it when they colonised Egypt and renamed the lake to “Lake
                Ptolemy” and described it as a marsh i.e “sea of reeds”. In
                South Sudan there is currently an impassable marsh called
                “Al-Sudd”, it is evident that the region between Al
                Sudd and Lake Ptolemy was a marshy terrain when the
                region was greener. This is the region that the Hebrews
                crossed with Moses, and is why in Zephaniah 3:10 it says
                <i>“From beyond the rivers of Cush my worshippers, my
                scattered people, will bring me offerings”</i>.
                Lake Chad used to be much larger as well and was connected to Lake Ptolemy by river/s, the current settlement in that region are still built along where the water flowed.
                This is consistent with the oldest maps in the world
                that used to consider the Niger river as an extension of the
                Nile river.

                Western historians treat the

                the Kushites (native African) as foreign, so now due to strategically
                tainted history people associate Cleopatra who was a greek

                The reason why the Greco-Rromans distorted our
                understanding of Egypt was so that we do not understand the Africa is the source of the true story.
            
                "Jew" used to refer to the followers of <a href="about.html">Moshi / Moses</a> who followed the true god and lived

                Taharqa of the Kushite 25th dynasty is described in Isaiah
                37:9 and 2 kings 19:9 as going to fight the king of Assyria
                who was threatening Israel. The dependency of Israel on Egypt and Kush as a buffer from the foreign evil is a common theme occurring in scripture such as 2 Kings 18:21, Isaiah 20:5, Isaiah 30:1-2, Isaiah 43:3 and Amos 9:7.
                . This would not make sense if Israel was

                of these leaders are named after Moses like Mansa Musa of Mali. , The word “Dad” is derived from this.
                Moshe (Moses) is the reason why  in Sepedi and related languages “Mose” means
                smoke, it corresponds to the location “Moshi” located in
                Tanzania by Mt Kilimanjaro because that is where Moses/
                Moshi went up to speak to god and scripture explains
                there was so much smoke that the Israelites were scared to
                go up hence why his name is associated with smoke.

                “Home of the jew”. There are significant archaeological
                sites in the region that the people there say was built by a
                previous group of people (the original inhabitants were

                throughout the continent. Africans / Hebrews have had traditional Priest-Monarch-Judges that ritually slaughtered animals as sacrificial

                 “Unleavened bread” appears throughout the English bible due to it being very significant in Hebrew culture.
                The Jews were
                supposed to celebrate the “festival of unleavened bread”.
                Unleavened bread is bread made without yeast.
                Deuteronomy 16:3: <i>“Do not eat it with bread made with
                yeast, but for seven days eat unleavened bread, the bread
                of affliction, because you left Egypt in haste—so that all the
                days of your life you may remember the time of your
                departure from Egypt”</i>.
                The hebrews were leaving Egypt in a rush there was no
                time to bake bread and wait for the yeast to rise.
                The primary ingredients of leavened bread is yeast and
                grain plants such as wheat / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eish_merahrah">maize</a> thus “Unleavened bread” is simply Pap / Ugali / Fufu .

                Followers of Judaism use what they call a “shofar” which is
                a Kudu horn, there are no kudus in the middle east. The
                Kudu is an African animal.
                Are vuvuzelas also from the
                fake israel? Let’s not be stupid.
                The deception has been going
                on for too long.

                The people of the book have a clan-based society. They often name the clans after the
                founder of the clan, alliances with other groups often start
        with marriages between royalty because then the clans
                become merged and intermarriage becomes common. A
                clan is a society that is viewed as an extension of your
                family, <img src="vuvuzela.png" alt="2" class="float-right" style="max-width:25vw"> political ideologies such as Nationalism and Fascism
                are just the result of political leaders trying to construct new
                clans i.e a nation. The international merchants hate such
                systems and push for individualism because if we truly
                viewed our society as an extension of our family we would
                not tolerate its degradation like we do now,  we would see our neighbours
                as distant family. A big family willing to help each other in
                times of need does not need loans from a bank, does not
                need to beg on the street, and does not need to tolerate a
                working environment where they are disrespected and
                undervalued. The merchants could never profit off of a self-sufficient clan that owned their own land and resources.

                Jew is an english word, it has the same etymology as
                judiciary and judicates because the Hebrews were rules by the equivalent of Judges. The 
                enemy will accuse me of being “afro-centric” but the
                island of Sardinia located in the Mediterranean Sea near
                Italy and France is evidence. Sardinia had historically
                resisted Vatican/Roman domination and the kingdom was
                divided into 4 “Judicates” (The equivalent of provinces)
                ruled by 4 “Judges”. This is their flag and the coat of arms
                which it is derived from. These things are
                not random, the words we use are not random.

                Dry stone masonry is
                a technique where
                stones are stacked
                and fitted together
                without the use of
                mortar or other
                bonding agents.
                Instead, the structure
                relies on the precise
                placement of stones
                to create a stable and
                durable construction. Dry stone masonry requires far more
                skill than brick and mortar and has been used for centuries.
                This is a technique we find all over Africa and it is what physically links
                the history.<img src="zim.png" alt="" class="float-left" style="max-width:25vw"> In Southern Africa theres the Bokoni settlements
                in Mpumalanga, and various sites in the region such as the
                Khami and Dzata (Judah) ruins, and the well known Great
                Zimbabwe. “Zimbabwe” just means “House of Stones” a
                reference to the numerous archaeological sites in the
                region. This same architecture can be found as far north as
                Cameroon where theres the Diy-Gid-Biy site and in Sudan where it is associated with
                the “mysterious” so called Daju (the jew) people with a “Tora” (Torah) dynasty obviously related to the “Torwa” dynasty associated with
                Great Zimbabwe.
