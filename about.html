        </div>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px;padding-top: 60px;">The orginal alphabets such as Heiroglyphs and Hebrew did not have
            vowels, vowels are ambigous and vary in pronunciation. This is a contributing reason why using the Latin
            alphabet for indigenous languages results in variations of spelling for the same words. It is because the
            letters no longer correspond to unique individual sounds, "J" for example did not exist more than 500 years
            ago. The Chitas were from Judah before they removed the Djed 𓊽 𐤎 . The following table of contents
            provides a
            vowel-less heiroglyph perspective to reveal the true story. </p>
