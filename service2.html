        <p>What kind of land would the creator of all things give to his chosen people? Israel controls and profits from
            the diamond trade yet have no diamond mines. This is why the diamond museum in Tel Aviv, Israel is named
            after Nicky Oppenheimer, founder of De Beers, because he made sure that the Africa's land and people were
            exploited for the benefit of Israel's economy and his descendants maintain the status qou. The corrupted
            merchants and multinationals of the world are well aware which land is special. </p>

                The scripture say that the Israelites took the land that the descendants of Canaan lived in, Canaan was a
                son of Ham / Cham / Kemet / Kemi
                <br><br>

                Judah’s totem is a lion (still is for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombo">Mandinka</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewe_people">Ewe</a> hence why it means lion in their languages) which has been appropriated by
                European royal dynasties since the fall of Israel. This is why
                there is a greek letter of a cross called “Tau” which means
                lion in Sepedi and related languages because the Koine
                Greek script itself was made in Alexandria, Egypt and their
                writing systems are based on the original true symbols that have since been
                manipulated. This is why one of the kings associated with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kingdom_of_Egypt">"Egyptian Empire"</a> is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seqenenre_Tao">“Seqenenre Tao”</a> meaning "The brave", the Egyptians had tamed Cheetahs thats were symbolicaly signicant during this period. The Cheetahs were from Judah.
                The letter “J” is one of many recent inventions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gian_Giorgio_Trissino">(1500s)</a> to distort the truth.

                The land of Canaan is described as being a land flowing
                with “milk and honey” in Exodus 3:8t.
                This is the range of the African honeybees:
                Wikipedia will tell you:
                “In terms of industrial honey
                production, in its natural habitat and
                the neo-tropics, the African bee
                produces far more honey than its
                European counterparts. It is unclear
                if this is due to a superior nectar
                gathering ability, lack of adaptability
                in the European honey bees for
                tropical environment, or both”
                <br><br>
                Arguably
                the best cattle, the “Sanga Cattle”
                and associated breeds are found in
                the
                same region. This is why
                Americans imported the cattle
                decades ago and set up a breeding society to create their
                modern “Ankole-Watusi” one of which holds the record for
                the largest horns of any cattle.

                lions, leopards, rhinoceros(which is a unicorn) all mentioned
                in scripture, then they will say there used to be all these
                animals in the fake Israel and somehow they magically
                disappeared, the same way the entire jewish nation
                magically disappeared from Palestine, then they will use the
                US/De Beers/Merchant funded wealth to try to convince you
                <br><br>
                that their land is blessed, they tried “reintroducing” ostriches
                there but surprise surprise the population could not survive
                in a random desert.
                Where are the giraffes? Roman bibles had to translate
                giraffe as “Camelopardalis” this is why in Afrikaans they still
                say “kameelperd” as giraffe.

                The Sycamore Fig Trees which have biblical significance is
                found all over Africa, and is known as “mugumo” by the
                Kikuyu who still associate it closely with the true god and
                their culture. Acacia trees are mentioned throughout the bible. These are
                acacia trees, they want you to believe these are somehow
                associated with the fake israel. The <a href="https://identify.plantnet.org/k-world-flora/species/Solanum%20incanum%20L./data">Solanum Incanum (Solomon in Canaan)</a> 
                is grown around Kenya and was called Jew's Apple by the merchants.

                Moses did not cross a red sea, he went though a "Sea of reeds" based on the orignal Hebrew i.e a marsh. This was approximately what
                the greeks remamed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Ptolemy">"Lake Ptolemy"</a> in Northwest Sudan. The South was viewed as Up during the era of Moses and <a href="service6.html"></a>Ancient Egypt</a>, thats why Lower Egypt is in the North and the oldest Arabic maps were <a href="https://oldmapster.com/oldest-map-of-arabia/">"upside down"</a>.
